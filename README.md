This is a set of fundamental data from a Farmland Management Center in Weifang City, 
including the coordinates of the farmland locations, robot depot coordinates, farmland area/pesticide requirements, 
and the existing types of robots in the depot along with their respective functional parameters.

This data is used to validate the performance of Q_DPIG in scheduling multiple weeding-robots to complete farmland weeding operations.
